# Fire Detection - TensorFlow

[Fire Detection] - Fire Detection using TensorFlow. Model used: Faster-RCNN Object detection. Problem faced by SCDF was fires were detected late hence fires in buildings are often reported late resulting in a larger fire. With this, there would be a earlier report to the SCDF to allow them to react in a quicker response time.
